# Backbone.Extension

Some useful extensions to the Backbone.View class, including:

* Named ui elements (shamelessly stolen from Backbone.Marionette)
* Can use named ui elements in events object definition
* Pub/Sub pattern (shameless stolen from Cowboy Ben Alman)
* globalEvents object, to subscribe to published events
